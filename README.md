Description: 
This project is a labyrinth/maze game in which a “ball” is rolled around a maze with pitfalls and walls. The primary characteristic of the Booster Pack™ that will be utilized by this program is the accelerometer. It is used to control the position of the ball. Other features of the board which can be taken advantage of include: the potentiometer to change the speed of the ball, the buttons to change maps or difficulties, the LED to display to update the users on the state of the game. Finally, our game will have multiple (possibly randomly generated) maps and variable difficulties to satisfy a multitude of users.
